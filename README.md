# Predicting Endometriosis: A Machine Learning Approach to Biomarker Discovery from RNA-Seq and Methylation Data

**A readme and report with a detailed description of the project and a subsequent report were included.**

The main goal of this project is to find potential biomarkers for endometriosis by combining information from gene expression (RNA-seq) and DNA methylation (MBD-seq) data. 

We aim to identify specific genes and gene expression patterns that differ between endometriosis and healthy patients. Furthermore, machine learning techniques will be employed to predict disease based on significant
results from differential gene expression and differential methylation analysis.

Endometriosis is a condition that currently requires invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. As a predominately female group, we have a strong commitment to advancing womenâ€™s health and are passionate about contributing to improvements in this field through modern bioinformatic workflows like differential gene expression and methylation analysis, GO enrichment analysis, and various machine learning approaches.
